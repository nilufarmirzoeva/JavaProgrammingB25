Single Dimensional Array: container for the elemnts
		10
		20
		40

Multi Dimensional Array: container for the arrays
Outer loop i ==>index of array;
Inner loop j ==>index of array;


A multi-dimensional array is an array with more than one level or dimension. For example, a 2D array, or two-dimensional array, is an array of arrays, meaning it is a matrix of rows and columns (think of a table). A 3D array adds another dimension, turning it into an array of arrays of arrays.
